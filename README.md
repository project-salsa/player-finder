A cross platorm app built using React Native. Matches local gamers up with each other.

## Starting the App

Run `npm start`, and use the Expo app to scan the QR code given. The app will automatically re-compile with any changes.

## First Time Setup Guide
1. Install node (any version will likely work, but this has been tested on v8.0+)
2. Install npm version 4.6.1 - `npm i -g npm@4.6.1`
3. Run `npm i` inside of the base directory
4. Install watchman (might be optional, try without first) (instructions [here](https://medium.com/@vonchristian/how-to-setup-watchman-on-ubuntu-16-04-53196cc0227c) (for Ubuntu))
5. Run `npm start` and wait for the QR code to appear. If it doesn't, ping Reno on Discord and tell him he has sucky instructions.
